# Sales_Prediction_Solved
#### **Type:** Classification
#### **By:** Oscar Castanaza

- In this task we have implemented basic techniques to take care of Duplicates, NaNs, and more Inconsistendies,
- We have trained and prepared our data for Machine Learning,
- And Finally Commited certain metrics to evaluate our data processing.

# Business task:
We Created an algorithm that is able to take care of missing values and helped our Bussines to see which products permormed better and we also helped to classify what type of clients could buy our products.


# "Variable Name	Description"
- **Item_Identifier:	Unique product ID.
- **Item_Weight:**	Weight of product.
- **Item_Fat_Content:**	Whether the product is low fat or regular.
- **Item_Visibility:**	The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product.
- **Item_Type:**	The category to which the product belongs.
- **Item_MRP:**	Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product.
- **Outlet_Identifier:**	Unique store ID.
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year:**	The year in which store was established.
- **Outlet_Size:**	The size of the store in terms of ground area covered.
- **Outlet_Location_Type:**	The type of area in which the store is located.
- **Outlet_Type	Whether:** the outlet is a grocery store or some sort of supermarket.
- **Item_Outlet_Sales:**	Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the target variable to be predicted.

# Most Important Metrics & Model:

- R-squared (R2) is a measure of how well the regression model fits the data, with higher values indicating a better fit. 
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a measure of the average difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the test dataset, with lower values indicating better predictive performance. 
 - **Both metrics are important in evaluating the performance of regression models and can help you make decisions about refining or selecting a model.**

Based on the results obtained from the above code, we can see that the Decision Tree model has a higher r^2 score and a lower rmse score compared to the regression tree model. Therefore, we can recommend using the Decition Tree model for this dataset.

# Recomendations:
I recomend to have a clear understanding of Metrics and a clear understanding of Python and Sickit Learn Syntax.
